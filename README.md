### Task

Code test - goal:

1. node.js code to parse XML file (sample is included in the CodeTest-XML.xml file) into JSON messages that will be stored in database;
that data from database will be later displayed in the Web UI as a grid (Form, Message) - (no, no need to implement UI)
2. Code should do parsing only and just call db.save(message) (no need to implement db.save)
3. XML file can be very large (~500MB)
4. Code doesnâ€™t have to be a complete working solution and should be whatever can be done in no more than 3 hours

What I will be looking at the code:

- Production quality - code maintainability:
- Readability
- Code structure
- Namings
- Error handling
- Logging for troubleshooting
- Following of any commonly used code guidelines
- Attention to the requirements
- Usage of modern JavaScript features (ES6)
- Unit testing
- How much code will be done in no more than 3 hours.
